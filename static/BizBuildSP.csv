"#01142","Year number 1 is about to end."
"#01143","Year number 20 is about to end."
"#01144","Too bad... That store has been shut down."
"#01145","You seem to have enough manager-class employees."
,"Try again after dismissing one of your current managers."
"#01146","I see... That's too bad, but I understand."
,"I'll start the procedures for shutting the store down, then."
"#01147","Boss! Now we don't have any stores..."
"#01148","Let's try again! I'm sure we can make a great store!"
"#01149","You don't seem to have a store..."
"#01150","Welcome!"
"#01151","Thank you!"
"#01152","Not enough funds..."
"#01153","Not enough hearts..."
"#01154","Not enough coins..."
"#01155","Not enough points..."
"#01156","Hmm... We don't seem to have enough left in the budget."
,"Let's look into it when <co=0070c0>next year's budget</co> comes out."
"#01157","Uh-oh... You don't have anything that you can sell."
,"Goods for sale will be refreshed in a few months."
"#01158","Oh, you don't seem to have anything that I can buy. Feel free to try again later."
"#01159","You don't seem to have any items."
"#01160","You put <co=0070c0><0></co> in charge of the store."
,"It will be run as an ""auto-pilot store"" from now on. I'm sure it'll work out well!"
"#01161","This is a big responsibility!"
,"I'll return the staff who had been working here to you."
,"I'll do my very best to increase sales!"
"#01162","I understand..."
,"I'll return the staff who had been working here to you."
,"I'll work my hardest!"
"#01163","Understood!"
,"I'll return the staff who had been working here to you."
,"You can look forward to big things from me--and big sales!"
"#01164","Boss!"
,"I found some part-time staff who may fit the bill!"
"#01165","Thank you! I'll be the best part-time worker you've ever seen!"
"#01166","R-Really...? You're hiring me?!"
,"This is a dream come true! I'll work really hard--I promise!"
"#01167","I'll work my fingers to the bone! Well, maybe not. But I will work hard!"
,"I can't wait to get started!"
"#01168","Boss!"
,"Somebody who says they used to run a rival store wants to talk to you!"
"#01169","I am humbled."
,"I'll make the most of my experience managing many different stores. I won't fail this time!"
"#01170","Thank you for hiring me!"
,"With my talent, your store is guaranteed to be a success!"
"#01171","Yes!"
,"I researched you thoroughly when I was your rival, so I should have a head start!"
"#01172","We're currently searching for new candidates."
,"Please wait a bit longer."
"#01173","What type of store would you like to manage?"
"#01174","Let's assign some staff to your new store."
"#01175","You're ready to open! Let's make this place a big success!"
"#01176","I tried assigning a staff member who was in the waiting room."
,"Try and keep a good balance between all of your stores."
"#01177","You don't have enough <co=0070c0>manager-class</co> staff members."
"#01178","You don't seem to have any <co=0070c0>management goods</co>."
"#01179","You don't seem to have any <co=0070c0>equipment</co>."
"#01180","You don't seem to have any <co=0070c0>upgrade items</co>."
"#01181","The results of your <0> introduction have arrived!"
,"Let's take a look..."
"#01182","Wow! It was a success!"
"#01183","It looks like it failed..."
,"Too bad. We'll have to try again."
"#01184","It looks like this location isn't suitable. Try another."
"#01185","It's almost time for the mayoral election."
,"Who should we nominate as a candidate?"
"#01186","<0> has been elected the new mayor."
"#01187","Voting for the new mayor is about to begin!"
,"Let's all keep our fingers crossed for <0>."
"#01188","Gulp..."
,"I hope all of that hard work will pay off..."
"#01189","Unfortunately, it didn't work out..."
,"If only their stats were a bit higher, maybe they could've won..."
,"You can try again in the election 3 years from now!"
"#01190","You can't add any more."
"#01191","Leave it to me!"
"#01192","Hee hee! I'm ready!"
"#01193","I'm looking forward to it!"
"#01194","Awesome! I can't wait!"
"#01195","You made the right choice!"
"#01196","Choose the participants!"
"#01197","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"For a while, this should make it easier to build a facility like a new <1>!"
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01198","I see..."
,"We'll discuss stopping <1> construction at the next meeting."
"#01199","I see. Yes, that kind of introduction should be very effective."
,"We'll have a serious discussion about this at our next meeting."
"#01200","Talks with the facility to be introduced are now complete!"
,"You just have to select <co=0070c0>""Store"" > ""Introduce""</co> from the menu."
"#01201","I see! Everybody likes a good <0>..."
,"This should be a good chance to make a name for <town>!"
,"We'll start discussing it right away so we can put our name in the running!"
"#01202","It's time for the location for the <0> to be announced."
,"Let's go to the hall right now!"
"#01203","We had another successful <0> this year..."
,"And we would love for <town> to host us again next time!"
"#01204","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"That should increase our population."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01205","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"That should help increase land prices and let you open bigger stores."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01206","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"If customers have more spending money, it should help boost your sales."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01207","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"It should help our residents feel better about using your store."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01208","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"For a while, construction in town should go faster!"
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01209","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"<1>-type facilities will evolve and be remodeled."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01210","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"The more tax income we get, the more the town's construction will advance."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01211","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"Reducing taxes will give customers more money to spend when shopping."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01212","This policy requires a few more <0>-type facilities in town."
"#01213","Actually, ""<0>"" is currently in progress."
"#01214","Oops! To dismiss someone, they can't be performing research or on a treasure hunt."
"#01215","Oh dear!"
,"Store #<0> has been defeated by its rival..."
"#01216","We just got some information about a contest!"
"#01217","Congratulations on winning the <0>!"
"#01218","Unfortunately, you lost..."
,"Try training your staff a bit more and give it another try!"
"#01219","Unfortunately, you lost..."
,"Try researching your products a bit more!"
"#01220","It's time to start remodeling."
,"Look forward to your brand-spanking new store!"
"#01221","Store #<0> has been remodeled."
,"Let's put our hearts and souls into making it the best store it can be!"
"#01222","Your store <co=0070c0>met its quota!"
,"Now you can manage it without any time limits!"
"#01223","You don't seem to have any staff..."
"#01224","=#01177"
"#01225","You don't seem to have any staff."
"#01226","What's this...?"
,"You don't have a cash register in this store. The customers don't know how to pay!"
,"Let's place one right away!"
"#01227","By the way, boss..."
,"Have you thought about what to do about the museum's <co=0070c0>admission fee?"
,"It can be a very important source of income, so the right balance is key!"
,"You can change it by <co=0070c0>selecting the cash register."
"#01228","To dismiss a manager-class staff member, you must first assign them to the waiting room."
"#01229","Actually, you seem to be pretty well staffed at the moment."
,"If you must search for new staff, you'll need to dismiss some first."
"#01230","Select a product to stock on the shelves."
"#01231","You don't have any products that can be stocked."
,"Performing research can sometimes lead to the discovery of new products."
"#01232","The new budget for <town> has been decided."
"#01233","Wow... This looks like a really comfortable room."
,"This should help me concentrate on my work!"
"#01234","Awesome! Now I can work without getting tired out!"
"#01235","Nice! I can't believe what a cool room this is!"
"#01236","Starting next month, the hours of all stores will be <co=0070c0><0>:00 to <2>:00</co>."
"#01237","Starting next month, all stores will be open <co=0070c0>24 hours</co> a day."
"#01238","The next rank-up prize is about to be announced!"
"#01239","A lovely <0> is your prize!"
,"And here's what's inside!"
"#01240","Keep working on going up in rank!"
"#01241","<0> is currently performing research. You'll have to wait a bit."
"#01242","I've got this!"
"#01243","No problem!"
"#01244","I can't wait to get to work!"
"#01245","Congratulations on another year of hard work."
,"Here is the yearly report for <0>."
"#01246","Give badges to the staff members who worked hardest during the year!"
,"Badges really help staff members' future development, so choose wisely who to give them to."
"#01247","Give badges to the staff members who worked hardest during the year!"
"#01248","Now for the score announcement."
"#01249","After the 20th year, your online ranking high score will not be refreshed, and cannot be registered."
,"If you want to try for a high score, select ""New Game"" from the title screen!"
"#01250","Let's try to make even higher sales next year!"
"#01251","It looks like the cart is too small."
,"Try selecting a bigger cart if you want better effects."
"#01252","Your staff are out searching for treasure."
,"Please wait until they return."
"#01253","You don't seem to be ready to serve <0>."
,"Make sure you've placed the required <co=0070c0>cookware and materials</co> in your back room."
"#01254","Select the type of materials."
"#01255","You are missing the following item: <0>."
"#01256","There are no customers you can target with ads now."
"#01257","Thanks for your business..."
,"The town has developed enough to unlock some new ad types. Give them a try!"
"#01258","You already have an ad in place. Please wait a bit."
"#01259","The ad has been placed."
,"Let's wait and see if it attracts anyone to the store!"
"#01260","Hmm... I came because of your ad, but..."
,"This just isn't quite the kind of store I'm looking for."
"#01261","Uh-oh. It looks like the target of our ad wasn't quite satisfied."
,"Increase the quality of the store's products and try again!"
"#01262","Boss!"
,"That ad must have been effective... A new customer is approaching the store!"
"#01263","The material was changed to <0>."
"#01264","You changed the entrance fee."
,"Changes in entrance fees will be reflected next month."
"#01265","Boss! Let's keep at least one store going!"
"#01266","It seems like assigning one manager-class employee to each store works best."
,"Swap a manager for another to assign him or her to a different store."
"#01267","That manager has already been put in charge of another store."
"#01268","You can only manage up to <co=ff0000><0></co> stores at once."
,"To start another store, you must <co=ff0000>release one</co>. Select ""Store"" > ""Store Info"" from the menu."
,"The store you release will be changed into an ""auto-pilot"" store."
"#01269","You can have up to <co=ff0000><0></co> ""auto-pilot"" stores."
,"You may want to close down a store with low profits."
"#01270","You can't release a store that's less than 1 year old..."
"#01271","You don't have enough manager-class staff to run for mayor."
"#01272","They said they can't run in an election and manage a store at the same time."
,"Admirable sense of responsibility!"
"#01273","To refill your <0> stock, you require ""<1>"" materials."
,"Build a material depot in your back room to get ""<1>"" materials."
"#01274","<0>'s growth type is already <1>."
"#01275","Changing <0>'s growth type..."
,"...will require <1> staff badges."
"#01276","This store doesn't deal in food."
"#01277","You don't have the rights to open a new store."
"#01278","To change to the next cart, you first need to put an item in the cart."
"#01279","You cannot place that, as you have reached the maximum <co=0070c0>furnishings cost</co>."
,"As the town develops, the maximum cost <co=0070c0>will increase</co> and you will be able to build bigger stores."
"#01280","You cannot place that, as you have reached the maximum <co=0070c0>Staff Cost</co>."
,"As the town develops, the maximum cost will increase."
,"Please move someone to the <co=ff0000>waiting room</co>."
"#01281","You cannot place that, as you have reached the maximum Staff Cost."
"#01282","Oh! Boss!"
,"Everybody in town is talking about how well the staff at Store <co=0070c0>#<0></co> work together!"
,"The store's popularity is sure to skyrocket!"
"#01283","<town> is an area with beautiful natural scenery."

"#01284","<town> is surrounded by nature, and the centrally located station should spur development."
,"Let's pick out a location for our first store!"

"#01287","<town> is a thriving town with an airport."

"#01289","Let's make this place a big success!"
,"I think we can expect some customers very soon!"
"#01290","You don't have shelves for putting items on sale..."
,"Once you have shelves in your store, you can have a sale."
"#01291","You don't have any shelves that you can use the <0> on."
,"Place some shelves in your store that can be refilled."
"#01292","You don't have any shelves that you can use the <0> on."
,"Try placing a variety of furnishings in your store."
"#01293","You placed a sale card!"
,"Prices will be lower for about 2 months, which should hopefully attract the attention of customers."
"#01294","You don't have any dishes to serve to customers..."
,"Please select at least one."
"#01295","Leave Store <co=0070c0>#<0></co> to me!"
"#01296","Placing a <co=0070c0>cash register</co>?"

,"Having at least two registers in a store will help checkout go more smoothly!"
"#01297","Tap the item you want to move."
,"The direction it faces is also important."
"#01298","Placing a <co=0070c0>material depot</co>?"
,"Depots are used to store various types of materials used to make products."

,"Depots are refilled in the morning and evening."
"#01299","Placing a <co=0070c0>staff room</co>?"

,"These furnishings are required for preparing food."
,"At present, you are able to serve these foods."
"#01301","You may also need materials. In that case, try placing a <co=ff0000>materials depot</co>."
"#01302","You also need to <co=0070c0>select the dish</co> you will be serving."
"#01303","Placing an <co=0070c0>outside furnishing</co>?"
,"These can help attract customers who might not have originally intended to go into your store."
"#01304","Placing a <co=0070c0>bike rack</co>?"
,"Place one of these outside your store to increase the satisfaction of customers coming on bikes!"
"#01305","This is your first time performing research for <name>, isn't it?"
,"Research helps improve products, and is performed by manager-class staff while the store is closed."
,"This can have a big effect on product prices and customer satisfaction."
,"When you have items, try and research as much as possible!"
"#01306","Hello! Thank you for coming!"
,"I'd love to hear your opinions about how to help <town> develop!"
"#01307","Welcome!"
,"Here you can buy the rights to open new kinds of stores such as bookstores and noodle bars."

,"Reducing the fee may attract more visitors."
,"Try and keep a good balance!"
"#01310","Boss! What are we gonna do?!"
,"A <co=ff0000>rival</co> store has appeared near Store #<0>!"

"#01312","Not bad for a first try!"

"#01360","Boss..."

,"By the way, I entered a contest on one of those blogs, and I won! Here, you take the prize money."
,"Just be sure you make good use of it!"

"#01370","Boss..."
,"You're really running low on money, aren't you?"
,"We may have to cut out our daily snacks!"
,"...But before we do anything that drastic, use this money that I found in the corner of the safe!"

"#01371","Boss..."
,"You're running a bit low on hearts."

"#01372","Boss..."
,"You're running low on coins..."

"#01373","You now have more staff. They've been assigned to Store #1."

,"Also, if you start a new store in a well developed area, you may be able to manage a larger store!"
,"Try using the money you've got to make even more!"

,"Use them well!"
"#01382","You've got quite a few coins saved up!"

,"Why not try using them to upgrade your staff or research new products?"
"#01386","You've been losing money for some time now..."
,"If you have trouble getting your store out of the red..."
,"Try selecting <co=0070c0>""Staff"" > ""Staff List""</co> and assigning someone to the waiting room."
,"That can help reduce your upkeep costs."
,"You can also try rethinking your <co=0070c0>hours of operation or the furnishings</co> you've placed."

,"Try upgrading your furnishings and products to expand your store!"
"#01389","Competing with your rival has reduced your store's vitality..."
,"If you want to refill your <co=0070c0>vitality</co>..."
,"It seems that assigning many staff to the store is important!"
,"Try reevaluating your staff list!"
"#01390","To power up, you need to select an item."
"#01391","Each year, contests are held between stores around the country. It's almost time for them to start!"
